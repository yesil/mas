# refreshUsers.mjs Documentation

This script fetches users from LDAP, deduplicates them, and sends them to a target endpoint to keep a user list synchronized in MAS Studio.

## Core Functionality

1.  **Authenticates** with Adobe IMS to get an access token.
2.  **Fetches LDAP members** from predefined groups across multiple tenants.
3.  **Deduplicates users** based on `userPrincipalName`.
4.  **Sends unique users** to a `TARGET_ENDPOINT`.

## Required Environment Variables

- `CLIENT_ID`: Adobe I/O client ID.
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: Adobe I/O client secret.
- `LDAP_BASE_URL`: LDAP API base URL.
- `TARGET_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint URL for the user list.
- `ORG_ID`: Adobe Organization ID.

Missing variables will cause the script to error and exit.

## Obtaining `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`
