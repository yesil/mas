## 🧪 Nala E2E Tests

Nala tests run automatically when you **open this PR**.

### To run Nala tests again:

1. Add the `run nala` label to this PR (in the right sidebar)
2. Tests will run automatically on the current commit
3. Any future commits will also trigger tests **as long as the label remains**

### To stop automatic Nala tests:

- Remove the `run nala` label

> **Note**: Tests only run on commits if the `run nala` label is present. Add the label whenever you need tests to run on new changes.

## Test URLs:

- Before: https://main--mas--adobecom.aem.live/
- After: https://mwpw-NUMBER--mas--adobecom.aem.live/
