# SSH into GH actions

## action code

If you need to debug your action you can add this snippet to the workflow:

```
- name: Setup tmate session
    uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
    with:
        limit-access-to-actor: true
```

once you push to the branch you can find an ssh connection string in action logs.

## github account setup

you will need to have generated pair of SSH keys on your machine.
Follow this docu: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
check for existing keys, if doesn't exist generate a pair and add a public one to your github account.
