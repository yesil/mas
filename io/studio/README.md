# MasHealthCheck

## Setup / First Steps

- install aio cli running `npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli`
- Request access to I/O Runtime in Adobe Corp org (you can do that on #milo-dev)
- navigate to Developer Console https://developer.adobe.com/console
- in 'Merch at Scale Studio' project, create a workspace with your ldap
- in your workspace click on 'Download all' and copy the auth .json in root (/io/studio)
- run `aio app use <filename>`
- this should populate the `.env` and the `.aio` file in the project root (/io/studio)
- ask a colleague for values:
    - for health-check action,
      add ODIN_CDN_ENDPOINT,ODIN_ORIGIN_ENDPOINT,WCS_CDN_ENDPOINT,WCS_ORIGIN_ENDPOINT env vars to .env file
    - for ost-products-write, add AOS_URL and AOS_API_KEY, OST_WRITE_API_KEY env vars to .env file
- run `npm i`
- run `aio where` and verify output is:

```
aio where
You are currently in:
1. Org: Adobe Corp
2. Project: MerchAtScaleStudio
3. Workspace: your ldap
```

## Local Dev

- `aio app dev` to start your local Dev server
- App will run on `localhost:9080` by default
- open https://localhost:9080/api/v1/web/MerchAtScale/health-check

## Test & Coverage

- Run `aio app test` to run unit tests for ui and actions

## Deploy & Cleanup

Do not deploy all actions at the same time - this increases risks, provide -a <action-name> to specify what you are deploying.

- `aio app test && aio app deploy -a ost-products-read` to test and deploy an action to Runtime and static files to CDN
- `aio app undeploy` to undeploy the app

If you need to force re-deploy:

- `aio app deploy --force-deploy --no-publish`
  To deploy specific action
- `aio app deploy -a ost-products-read`

## Config

### `.env`

## please provide your Adobe I/O Runtime credentials
# AIO_RUNTIME_AUTH=

```

### `app.config.yaml`
